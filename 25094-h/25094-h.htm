<h1 class="s2">DAUGHTERS<br />OF DOOM</h1>

<p class="s4 pad4bot center">By H. B. HICKEY</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Deep in space lay a weird and threatening world. And it was
there that Ben Sessions found the evil daughters&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
</div>

<p>Beyond Ventura B there was no life; there was nothing but
one worn out sun after another, each with its retinue of
cold planets and its trail of dark asteroids. At least that
was what the books showed, and the books had been written by
men who knew their business. Yet, despite the books

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>

and the men who had written them, Ben Sessions went past
Ventura B, deliberately and all alone and knowing that the
odds were against his returning alive.</p>

<p>He went because of a file clerk&rsquo;s error. More
correctly, he went as the final result of a chain of events
which had begun with the clerk&rsquo;s mistake.</p>

<p>The clerk&rsquo;s name was Gilbert Wayne and he worked at
the Las Vegas Interplanetary Port. It was Wayne&rsquo;s job
to put through the orders for routine overhaul of
interplanetary rockets. Usually Wayne was quite efficient,
but even efficient men have bad days, and on one of those
days Wayne had removed from the active list the name of
Astra instead of its sister ship, the Storan.</p>

<p>The very next morning the Astra had been turned over to
Maintenance. Maintenance asked no questions.
<a id="putit" name="putit"></a>It was that
department&rsquo;s job to take the ship apart, fix what
needed fixing, and put it. Ten minutes later Jacobs saw
Armando

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>

Gomez was the mechanic detailed to check the rocket tubes.</p>

<p>Gomez, who always got that job because he was small and
slender, dutifully dropped his instruments into his overall
pockets and crawled into the left firing tube. Half an hour
later he stuck his head out of the tube and yelled to
Jacobs, who was in charge of the job:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Amigo! How many hours this ship she got?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jacobs ran his finger down a chart and discovered to his
surprise that the Astra had only two hundred hours on its
log since the last overhaul. Ordinarily a ship was checked
each thousand hours. He scratched his head but decided that
if Operations wanted the Astra tuned it was none of his
business. So he told Gomez not to ask useless questions and
to get back in the tube.</p>

<p>Anyone else but Gomez would have obeyed orders and forgotten
all about it. Ten minutes later Jacobs saw Armando&rsquo;s
head appear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Amigo!&rdquo; Gomez shouted. &ldquo;How many
hours?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two hundred!&rdquo; Jacobs shouted back, knowing he
would have no peace until Gomez was answered. &ldquo;Now get
to work! We ain&rsquo;t got all year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Gomez was out of the tube again in five minutes and
yelling for the foreman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you want now?&rdquo; Jacobs demanded. He
swung himself up on the catwalk beside Gomez.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something very funny in here, amigo,&rdquo; Gomez
replied. &ldquo;One plate she is too clean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Less work for you,&rdquo; Jacobs grunted. &ldquo;So
why complain?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nevertheless he took a look at the plate, which was near the
mouth of the tube. It should have been lightly encrusted
with the oxides of rocket fuel. Instead, it was only
beginning to dull, in strange contrast to its neighbors
which were welded to it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is queer,&rdquo; Jacobs muttered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><i>Si.</i></span> As you say,
<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">amigo</span>. Queer.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a id="jacobs" name="jacobs"></a>Once Jacobs&rsquo; interest
was aroused he was also not one
to let a matter drop; he told Gomez to work on another tube
while he consulted the front office. The front office was
not especially interested, but at Jacobs&rsquo; insistence
they called in a metallurgist. The metallurgist, whose name
was Britton, was fortunately a thorough young man. He
ordered the plate removed and sent to his laboratory for
complete analysis.</p>

<p>After that things happened fast. Britton scanned the
analysis of the plate and without hesitation called in his
superior who ordered a second test just to be safe, and then
notified Washington. Washington turned it over to
Interplanetary Intelligence, of which Carson was chief of
staff.</p>

<p>One week later Ben Sessions stood before Carson&rsquo;s
desk.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Sessions was only thirty-five, but in his few years with
&ldquo;Two Eyes,&rdquo; as the organization was known, he
had rung up an enviable record. Tall, lithe, darkly
handsome, he was well liked by the men who worked with him.
At the moment there was a puzzled frown on his face,
lengthening the line made by a scar which ran from his
forehead down the side of his nose. The scar was the result
of a crash landing on Neptune.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get it, sir,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A
single plate from a rocket tube .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. So what if it
didn&rsquo;t oxidize?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That makes me feel much better.&rdquo; Carson
smiled, an inner bitterness making the smile wry. &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t get it either,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;A
mechanic named Gomez got it; a foreman named Jacobs got it;
a lab man named Britton got it; but the chief of &ldquo;Two Eyes&rdquo;

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>

missed the boat. I feel swell about that.&rdquo;
He rose suddenly and hammered his fist on the desk.
&ldquo;Every one of us in Intelligence ought to be
cashiered!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take it easy,&rdquo; Ben cautioned. &ldquo;All
because of that plate?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Carson slumped back into his chair. &ldquo;Yes. And because
we have failed in our duty. Our only hope is that we may
have time to make it up. I&rsquo;ll give you the facts:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those tubes are made of Virium, but even Virium
develops scale. After next week it will develop even more,
because next week we make the changeover to the new fuel. If
Wayne had made his mistake two weeks later there would have
been so much deposit in the tubes that Gomez would not have
noticed the difference.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Virium is one of the most standardized products
in the world. So Gomez was rightly astonished that the tube
didn&rsquo;t oxidize evenly. Jacobs saw further. Virium is
the toughest metal we know of; if this piece was tougher it
might be a discovery of major importance. So Britton
analyzed the plate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now we get to the point,&rdquo; Sessions grinned.</p>

<p>Carson stabbed a finger at him. &ldquo;Right. And the point
is that this one section of plate is not Virium! In fact, it
is a substance which we are positive does not exist in our
system!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a second. What do you mean by
&lsquo;system&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean every single bit of matter that lies between
here and Ventura B.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s not a natural substance. Not an
element.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We thought of that. It&rsquo;s an element, and one we
know nothing of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mind if I sit down, sir?&rdquo; Ben asked
suddenly.</p>

<p>The enormity of the thing had struck him, almost dazzling
him with its implications. Carson laughed bitterly and
waved him to a chair, then went on talking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Precisely, Ben. The question is: How did this strange
substance get into the tube of an Interplanetary rocket
called the Astra? To answer that we checked on the ship. The
Astra is one of the few ships which have ever gone beyond
Ventura B!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I almost expected to hear that,&rdquo; Sessions said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It adds up, all right, doesn&rsquo;t it? A foreign
substance, a foreign system. But this substance had been
made into a plate. That means the work of intelligent
beings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who took the Astra on that trip?&rdquo; Sessions
asked, his body tense.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A licensed space explorer named Murchison. Two others
went with him but he returned alone. Claims they fell into a
chasm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But no explorer has reported life beyond Ventura
B,&rdquo; Sessions said, taking up the thread of thought. He
whistled softly. &ldquo;You must have been busy this last
week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Busy is no word for it. It&rsquo;s only three years
since anyone has been allowed to go outside our system. For
the purpose of science Interstellar Flight granted permits
to six licensed explorers. All returned with charts showing
only a desolate waste. In our own quiet way we have checked
on each of these six men, including Murchison, in the last
week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And we discovered something very interesting. The
six who returned from beyond Ventura B were not the same six
who went! They are identical in every facial, bodily, and
mental characteristic, identical enough to fool even the
families of the lost explorers. But when we secretly
photographed them with infra-red light we found that their

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>

skins contained elements foreign to our system!&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Ventura A and its sister star were the twin beacons that
marked the last outposts of the Earth System. Past them was
only a trackless waste of inter-stellar space. Ben Sessions
knew that the charts he carried were probably worse than
useless, were likely downright traps.</p>

<p>He and Carson had planned the trip. Carson had wanted to
send a fighting fleet but Ben had opposed the idea.
Wayne&rsquo;s mistake had led them to the uncovering of a
gigantic hoax, a hoax which could have only a sinister
purpose. Somewhere in the void ahead were sentient beings.
To send a fleet would be to let them know that their
existence was suspected.</p>

<p>Sessions let the automatic controls take over while he
examined the charts once more. They showed the constellation
which lay directly ahead, the one after that, and then
nothing for hundreds of millions of miles. Those first two
reflected a tiny amount of light from Ventura B and were
visible through telescopes, therefore it would have created
suspicion to falsify their position. Past them, however, the
blackness was too intense to penetrate.</p>

<p>The speed of the rocket ship increased. Atomic blasts
replaced those of the regular fuel. Sessions knew that an
Earth measurement would have shown the ship to have shrunk
to half its size. Only light and the radona beam which
protected the ship from collisions could travel faster.</p>

<p>From now on it was just a matter of luck. Someone had pulled
those six explorers out of space and Sessions was hoping the
same thing would happen to him. On the third day it
happened.</p>

<p>He was sitting in the pilot&rsquo;s chair, watching the
radona chart before him. Most of the chart was blank, only
the upper right hand corner showing a mass of black dots
which indicated a planetary dispersal about a dead star.
Sessions waited for the radona beam to swing the ship
leftward.</p>

<p>Instead, the ship was curving in the direction of the dots!
Ben&rsquo;s first thought was that the beam had gone out of
order, and he switched to manual controls. No use. Despite
all his efforts he was being carried toward those planets.</p>

<p>Habit made him shut off the tubes. Why waste fuel? A tight
smile froze on his lips as his speed dropped to twenty
million miles then lifted again as the ship by-passed a
planet. With calm deliberation Ben switched on the camera he
had installed before the flight and let it record his course
as shown on the radona chart.</p>

<p>Only one dot remained on the chart. It grew larger and
larger until it filled the entire screen. There was no
longer any doubt as to the ship&rsquo;s destination, and as
if to add further proof its speed dropped sharply. Ben
clicked the switch on the camera and removed a tiny roll of
microfilm. The roll fit snugly into the hollow cap which
covered the stub of one of his molars.</p>

<p>The altitude indicator went on automatically, showed fifty
thousand feet, then forty thousand, went down to hundreds.
Ahead there was only blackness. Ben held his breath and
waited for the crash. It never came. Long after the
altimeter showed zero the ship still moved. Ben could think
of only one explanation: he was below the surface of the
dark planet! And then he could think no more; the blackness
seemed to filter into the ship and into his mind.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&ldquo;He awakens,&rdquo; a voice said. It was a pleasant
voice, a feminine

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>

one, silky and soothing.</p>

<p>Ben Sessions sat up and said, &ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The first thing he noticed was the light. No more darkness,
but a light that came from nowhere and yet was everywhere.
He was on some sort of couch, in a huge room with a vaulted
ceiling. Shaking his head groggily, Ben looked for the
source of the silken voice. He was alone in the room.</p>

<p>His eyes ran down the length of his body. The flash gun was
gone from his belt. That was hardly unexpected. But the belt
was gone too. So were his clothes. He was clad in a loose
robe of shimmering white cloth.</p>

<p>That meant he had been unconscious for some time. How long?
Ben would have given much to know. Suddenly he let out an
unearthly moan, threw his arms wide and rolled off the
couch. He lay still.</p>

<p>The silken voice was raised again and added to it was
another, more masculine. Then a door opened and two people
stepped into the room. Ben sat up and grinned at them,
especially at the woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought that would get you,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not hospitable to hide from your
guest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Resourceful, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; The woman raised
her eyebrows in mock admiration. Her companion growled a
reply which Ben couldn&rsquo;t quite catch.</p>

<p>They were an odd pair, the woman towering well above ten
feet but perfectly formed, her skin the color of pink
marble; the man more beast than human. The women of Saturn
were as tall as she, Ben had time to think, but not nearly
as beautiful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Welcome to Teris, Ben Sessions,&rdquo; she said. Her
smile was the smile of the serpent of Eden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re pretty resourceful yourself,&rdquo; Ben
grinned.</p>

<p>He had carried no papers except a blanket permit from
Interstellar Flight. He wondered if the precaution he and
Carson had taken would prove to be in vain. The woman spoke
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ben Sessions, graduate of Neptune School of Rockets;
born in Taos, New Mexico, Earth; third of four children;
unmarried, unattached at present; first position, co-pilot
Earth-Vega Express&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She seemed to be choosing items at random from a memorized
list. The exhibition was intended to impress Ben and it was
succeeding. More than that, however, it was frightening. He
held his breath as she neared the end.</p>

<p>&ldquo;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. two years with Interstellar Communications;
presently a licensed space explorer, non-affiliated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pretty good,&rdquo; Ben said.</p>

<p>It was better than that. It was perfect. Only the end was
wrong. He and Carson had worked that out with the
psychoanalyst. The two of them had wanted to falsify the
entire biography, but the analyst had convinced them he was
right.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One lie I might attempt to pound into your very
subconscious by hypnotism; a dozen would be spread too thin.
We would leave holes. Under the type of electroanalysis you
seem to think might be used on you I can&rsquo;t even
promise one lie will hold up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ben reminded himself to recommend the man for honors if he
ever got back to Earth. He had certainly known his business;
but then, if he hadn&rsquo;t he would not be working for
&ldquo;Two Eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now that you&rsquo;ve told me all about myself maybe
you&rsquo;ll tell me what&rsquo;s going on,&rdquo; Ben said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of your compatriots can do that,&rdquo; the woman
told him. Her interest seemed suddenly to have waned.</p>

<p>She said a few words in a strange tongue to the man who
stood at her

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>

side. He grunted, bowed, and advanced toward Ben. Long arms,
covered with thick black hair, reached out. Ben dodged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be sorry if you make him use
force,&rdquo; the woman said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing like trying,&rdquo; Ben told her. He avoided
another grab and stepped in and smashed his fist to the
hairy man&rsquo;s jaw.</p>

<div class="figcenter w600"><a href="images/im800.jpg">
<img class="noborder" src="images/im600.jpg" alt="The ape-like figure rushed forward and Ben&rsquo;s head was thrown back by a mighty blow&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;." /></a>
<span class="caption">The ape-like figure rushed forward and Ben&rsquo;s head was thrown back by a mighty blow&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</span>
</div>

<p class="pad1top">He might as well have hit a wall. Before Ben could strike
another blow he was lifted from his feet by an upward slap
that threatened to tear loose one side of his face. Too
dazed to resist, he felt both his wrists encircled by a
tremendous hand. The woman&rsquo;s voice rose sharply in a
tone of command.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The corridor through which Ben Sessions was being led was
thronged with people. There seemed to be three classes:
rosy-skinned giantesses like his escort; men of his own
size, but also with pink complexions; and the squat, hairy
men who appeared to be nothing more than slaves.</p>

<p>It was plain that women dominated this society, and from
them Ben received curious but contemptuous glances. Any one
of these Amazons would have been considered a beauty on
Earth, so regular were their features, but they lacked an
air of feminine softness. Instead, cruelty lay thinly masked
beneath the surface.</p>

<p>At the end of the long corridor a huge door swung open and
Ben was led through it into an immense room. At the far end
of the room was a throne, and on it a woman. Ben blinked. As
well proportioned as the others he had seen, she was half
again as tall, twice as beautiful. He could not contain a
gasp of appreciation.</p>

<p>Thick violet hair fell almost to her shoulders, her skin was
luminous and flawless, her body breathtaking, more revealed
than concealed by a clinging gown of some filmy material. At
her breast, flashed a single violet jewel larger by far than
the famed sapphires of Uranus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I brought him as soon as he awakened,&rdquo; said the
woman with Ben.</p>

<p>A malevolent stare from the woman on the throne rested on
Ben. &ldquo;It was unnecessary,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We
have no further need of him. Take him to the field.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; Ben snapped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are addressing Arndis, Queen of Teris,&rdquo; he
heard his escort say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t give a hoot&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo; He never
finished the sentence. From behind the hairy slave seized
him, lifted him and flung him bodily toward the doors. The
interview was over.</p>

<p>They went for a while along the same corridor, then turned
off and followed a side passage for a way. It led steadily
downward to an arched opening and through that out of the
building. Here too the light was diffused, but much
brighter. Ben had to blink several times before he became
adjusted to it.</p>

<p>They were standing in the center of a vast level plain,
apparently endless and roofless, for overhead there was no
sky, only an increasing intensity of light. Ranged in rows
on the plain were thousands of space ships. Ben turned once
as they approached the first line of ships and saw behind
him the building from which he had just come. It rose
upward, a single block of shining stone, for almost a mile.
Alongside it were other buildings of the same material, but
none so large.</p>

<p>Then Ben and his two escorts were past the first rows of
ships. His eyes roved over them, trying to discover what
armament they carried. None was visible. Their firing tubes
were much the same as those of Earth design,

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>

but slightly smaller.</p>

<p>His attention was diverted from his study by a sudden
disturbance aboard the closest ship. The sound of an angry
feminine voice came clearly through an open porthole, and
mingled with it was a pleading, deeper tone. An instant
later a door was flung open and out of it came hurtling one
of the men of Teris. He hit the ground, rolled over, and
came to his knees facing the open door and the giant woman
who stood framed in it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That the man was pleading for his very life was obvious to
Ben, but it was equally plain that his pleas were having no
effect. The woman on the ship uttered a single contemptuous
word that cut the pleas short. On her face was a sadistic
anticipation such as Ben had never before seen. Slowly she
raised a cylinder in her hand and pointed it at the man on
the ground.</p>

<p>From the cylinder came a violet light, weak at first, but
growing in intensity as she pressed some sort of trigger.
The man shrieked in agony as the light played on him. Then
the smell of burning flesh came to Ben&rsquo;s nostrils, and
the shriek became a single high pitched scream which choked
off suddenly.</p>

<p>Ben&rsquo;s escort laughed with ghoulish enjoyment, said
something to the woman in the doorway, and gestured at the
charred body on the ground. The violet light grew to
blinding intensity. A puff of smoke and the body was gone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was that for?&rdquo; Ben gasped.</p>

<p>His escort smiled indulgently and shot a question at the
other woman. The reply was a shrug of shoulders and a few
short syllables.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He did something that displeased her,&rdquo; she told
Ben. At his look of horror she laughed again, apparently
pleased to have shocked him.</p>

<p>He noticed, as they went along, that the space ships
decreased in size. Those in the first rows had been
comparable to Earth&rsquo;s battle cruisers, those in the
last were one or two man jobs. His own ship, the <i>Rapier</i>,
was at the very end of the last line.</p>

<p>Beyond was a vast army of men, both rosy skinned and hairy,
at work on a gigantic excavation project. Great power
shovels scooped load after load of earth. But most of the
work was being done by the men who labored with primitive
pick and shovel.</p>

<p>Above the sound of digging rose the sharp voices of the
giant women of Teris, each with a battalion under her
command. As far as Ben&rsquo;s eyes could reach men were
digging at the ground.</p>

<p>He was hustling along to a point where a dirt spattered
group struggled with a metallic lining for the half-mile
hole it had excavated. At that point his escort turned him
over to the woman who bossed that crew. Ben saw in the hand
of the overseer one of the violet ray cylinders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Down there,&rdquo; she said curtly, pointing to where
a small knot of men worked on a terrace fifty feet below.
&ldquo;They will tell you what to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ben had found nothing strange in the fact that his escort
had spoken English fluently. She had been present at his
electroanalysis. But he doubted that all the women of Teris
could have the same command of the language. Nevertheless he
said nothing and clambered down the ladder to the terrace
beneath. Ben&rsquo;s unasked question was answered when he
saw the five faces turned up toward him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Earth men! Even the grime that covered them could not hide
that. And there was added proof in their widening eyes. They
were sorry to see another Earth man captive, yet happy at
sight of one of their own kind. Willing

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>

hands helped Ben down from the bottom rung of the ladder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d heard they had picked up another
ship,&rdquo; one of the men said. &ldquo;But we
weren&rsquo;t sure the rumor was true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True enough, as you can see. I&rsquo;m Ben
Sessions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His outstretched hand was grasped and shaken cordially.
Names were flung at him. Murchison, Davies, Kennard, Bannon,
Murchison.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a second,&rdquo; Ben said. &ldquo;I thought I
heard Murchison twice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did,&rdquo; said the big, rawboned man at whom he
was staring. &ldquo;The first is my daughter Sally.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was only then that Ben noticed how small and slender was
the figure of the one next to Murchison. Even the
girl&rsquo;s loose robe, similar to that of the men, could
not quite conceal her femininity. Her hair was cut short,
her hands toil hardened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Carson didn&rsquo;t tell me,&rdquo; Ben muttered. He
grinned at Murchison. &ldquo;I expected to find you and two
assistants, but I didn&rsquo;t know one would be your
daughter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Expected&mdash;?&rdquo; Hope glinted in five pairs of
eyes. Above them there was a shouted command to get to work,
and a cylinder was waved threateningly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll explain as we go along,&rdquo; Ben said
hastily. &ldquo;Show me what to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bannon, a short, thickset man with a mop of unruly black
hair shoved a pair of tongs into Ben&rsquo;s hands and
quickly explained how to hold the rivets with which the
group was working. In effect they were constructing a huge
cylinder. Looking down, Ben saw that it descended into the
bowels of Teris.</p>

<p>The others were pressing Ben for his explanation but he
insisted that they tell their stories first. The same thing
had happened to them as to him. Within some thousands of
miles of Teris they had felt a force pull them toward it.
Then they had passed out and awakened to find themselves
prisoners.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know all that,&rdquo; Ben said. &ldquo;But in all
the time you&rsquo;ve been here you must have found out a
good deal. What goes on here? Why are they taking prisoner
every one who approaches the planet? Why do they conceal its
existence from our system?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Murchison paused between blows of his hammer, as though to
wipe sweat from his brow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since you seem in a hurry,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I
will tell it in brief. You are in the center of a planet
whose evil people are engaged in one enterprise: the
conquering and subjugating of our universe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought that might be it,&rdquo; Ben nodded.
&ldquo;But subjugating billions of people may prove tougher
than they think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Their intention is to reduce our population so it can
be easily handled. And I can assure you that these women are
perfectly capable of slaughtering as many people as they
think necessary. They have both the means and the contempt
for human life that such an undertaking requires.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ben hazarded a guess. &ldquo;This project is part of their
preparation?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The final part. Since the surface of Teris has a
temperature of absolute zero it can only be reached from
here through a series of locks. What they are building now
are new locks big enough to handle their largest ships. As
soon as that&rsquo;s done they plan to attack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any idea when that will be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About a week, Earth time.&rdquo; Murchison&rsquo;s
shoulders sagged with despair. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been
wracking our brains for a way to stop them, but it&rsquo;s
no use. They&rsquo;re as clever as they are evil.
They&rsquo;ve even sent doubles of each of us men to Earth
to pave the way for the

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>

attack. I suppose you&rsquo;ve seen your double.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then they haven&rsquo;t made one. You have to be
awake while it&rsquo;s being done. I suppose they
didn&rsquo;t think it necessary now that there&rsquo;s so
little time left.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Less time than I thought,&rdquo; Ben grunted.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d better get moving.&rdquo; He tilted his
head back and shouted to the woman above.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>For a second time Ben stood before Arndis, queen of Teris.
Her eyes probed at him, trying to divine his thoughts. There
was anger in those eyes. If she detected a single flaw in
his story it would mean Ben&rsquo;s death. More than that,
it would mean disaster for Earth. He talked fast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When we found that plate in the firing tube of
Murchison&rsquo;s ship we knew he was lying. We figured
he&rsquo;d discovered valuable deposits out here and was
trying to keep them secret.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s enough, isn&rsquo;t it? Enough for
Interplanetary Intelligence to send me on this mission.
Those false papers I carried are proof that we suspected
something. And if I&rsquo;m not back in the time we allowed
they&rsquo;ll have our entire battle fleet out looking for
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very clever,&rdquo; Arndis smiled. &ldquo;But if you
are trying to frighten us you are failing. The women of
Teris had a high civilization before your Earth was born. We
can do things you never dreamed of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At her command Ben&rsquo;s arms were seized and bound behind
him. He was carried swiftly into a room nearby, a room
filled with a maze of scientific apparatus. On what appeared
to be an operating table was a transparent shell, and
beneath this Ben was strapped.</p>

<p>Through the shell he saw one of the men of Teris brought
into the room and placed in a similar position on another
table. Wires were strung between the two shells and
somewhere a machine began to hum. The shells filled with a
white vapor that lingered a moment and then was gone.</p>

<p>Although he had known what was to happen Ben could not
control his amazement. For the man who came out of the other
shell was an exact replica of himself! Within minutes he saw
the other dressed in his own flying suit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see how simply we solve the problem?&rdquo;
Arndis asked. &ldquo;Ben Sessions will return to Earth and
there will be no search. He will report that he found
nothing and request that he be allowed to try again. By that
time we shall be ready to attack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ben&rsquo;s arms had been untied, and now he put his hand to
his face, as though to rub some tender spot. The move
attracted no undue attention. An instant later he had two
fingers inside his mouth and was working loose the cap over
his tooth.</p>

<p>His next move took them completely by surprise. With a leap
he was half way across the room and lunging for his double.
Ben brought the man down with a flying tackle and for
seconds they wrestled on the floor. Then a hairy hand tore
Ben loose and he was hauled to his feet. He had done little
harm to the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not quite fast enough,&rdquo; Arndis said.
&ldquo;Within minutes he will be aboard the Rapier and on
his way.&rdquo; Her voice rose. &ldquo;Take this one back to
the locks.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it ever get dark here?&rdquo; Ben
asked.</p>

<p>He and Murchison and the others had been allowed to come out
of the tube after what seemed hours of toil. They sat now in
a tiny cell into which air came through slits in the wall.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Murchison said. &ldquo;But Bannon has a
good watch and we&rsquo;re able to keep track of time.
It&rsquo;s exactly six days and three hours since you were
put to work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ben nodded thoughtfully. There was not much time left. Work
on the locks went on endlessly, and sooner than he could
have believed possible they were being completed. Given
enough slaves, he thought, anything could be accomplished.</p>

<p>Gluing his eyes to one of the slits, he peered out. The last
of the giant gates was being installed. Their own crew would
have only one more shift before the job was finished.</p>

<p>Beyond the excavation Ben could see the tower from which the
locks were controlled. Bannon, who had been in Teris longest
and who had managed to garner some information, had
explained their operation to Ben.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I worked on the new controls when they were being
installed,&rdquo; he said, ranging himself alongside Ben.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re fully automatic. There are five locks
in each tube between the interior and the surface of
Teris.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How many ships did you say were kept at the
tower?&rdquo; Ben asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About ten. They make inspection flights each day,
although nothing has ever gone wrong that I&rsquo;ve heard
of. But the tubes and the locks are the only outlets to the
surface and they watch them carefully.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are our chances of getting to the tower?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Zero, I should say. Only the women are allowed to
enter it, or a small crew under their supervision.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Willing to make a try?&rdquo; Ben asked. He swung
around to face them all. Until now he had not taken them
into his confidence, given them no inkling of what was in
his mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve talked about it before,&rdquo; Murchison
answered. &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s so little chance we gave
up the idea. Better to stay alive and hope for a
rescue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you how I know,&rdquo; Ben told
them, &ldquo;but there isn&rsquo;t going to be any
rescue.&rdquo; He kept his eyes on the girl. &ldquo;How
about you, Sally? Willing to trust me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She nodded and Ben heaved a sigh of relief. Rather than
leave her behind he would have stayed with her. Gathering
them about him he outlined his plans. The men were more than
skeptical but no one had any suggestions.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Ben and Davies were the last to finish their work, and as
they fastened the last rivet to the last hinge Ben looked up
and shook his head. To the giant woman who stood watching
him it seemed only that he was tired. She failed to notice
that Sally had drifted off to one side and was coming up
behind her.</p>

<p>Sally&rsquo;s foot suddenly caught the overseer just behind
one knee and knocked her off balance. At the same instant
Ben stepped in close and wrenched the violet ray cylinder
from the woman&rsquo;s hand. The others screened them from
sight. Ben looked around and saw that the slight flurry of
activity had gone unnoticed by others of the giant women who
were nearby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to walk to the control
tower,&rdquo; he told the woman grimly. &ldquo;If anyone
asks you&rsquo;re to say we have to do some work there.
I&rsquo;m going to have this ray gun trained on you under my
robe, so don&rsquo;t try any tricks. Understand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She understood all too well. A flicker of fear in her eyes
told Ben that she knew he would blast her without mercy.
They fell in behind her.</p>

<p>When they reached the doors of the tower a pair of women
barred their

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>

way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have received no notice of work to be done,&rdquo;
one of them said. Ben saw her eyes narrow with sudden
suspicion, and then her hand darted for the cylinder at her
side.</p>

<p>Ben&rsquo;s ray gun spouted violet death and the charred
bodies of three women lay in the doorway. Ben scooped up
their guns and thrust them at Bannon and Murchison.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll give you five minutes before we take
off,&rdquo; he shouted as they ran past him for the control
room.</p>

<p>Behind him and Davies and Sally there were shouts as the two
men went into action. But they had their own job to do. The
closest inspection ship was several hundred feet away and
already women were running to cut them off. Ben cut loose
with his cylinder before they had a chance to use theirs.</p>

<p>Then he and Davies were lifting Sally into the ship. While
they covered the open door Ben ran for the controls.
Somewhere an alarm was wailing and as he swung the ship
about Ben saw other ships being boarded. But Bannon and
Murchison had not failed. Just beyond the tower a lock swung
open.</p>

<p>Ben skimmed along the ground, figuring to pick up the two
men as they came out of the tower. Then he saw Murchison
wave him on. He had planted himself in the doorway and was
refusing to budge. Ben saw why as Murchison blasted away at
a group of giant women who were trying to rush the tower.</p>

<p>There was no more time. Already other ships were taking off.
Another wasted minute and they would beat him to the lock.
Ben yelled to Davies to close the hatch as he turned on the
power.</p>

<p>A moment later they were in the blackness of the tube.
Davies ran forward to the controls. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a
light on the ship,&rdquo; he said. He found the switch and
threw it in time for them to see the next lock open for
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three to go,&rdquo; Ben muttered. &ldquo;Looks like
we&rsquo;re going to make it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe not.&rdquo; Davies tapped his shoulder and
pointed to the rear of the ship. Looking back through a
porthole, Ben could see other ships behind them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As long as we&rsquo;re in the tube they won&rsquo;t
fire,&rdquo; Davies said. &ldquo;But neither can we get very
far ahead!&rdquo;</p>

<p>While he spoke the ship had gone through another lock with
the others still directly behind. It looked like Davies was
right. But Ben was not yet ready to concede defeat. The
fourth lock loomed ahead and he watched it swing open. Just
a few minutes more and they would go through the last one.
It was still hundreds of miles ahead but at the rate they
were travelling they would be on it soon.</p>

<p>He waited until the last possible second and then cut his
speed sharply. Behind them the other ships were forced to
use their retarding rockets for fear of ramming them. It was
just what Ben had expected. As the last lock opened he threw
the accelerator all the way forward and felt the ship leap
ahead.</p>

<p>That alone would not have been enough, but as the ship
roared out of the tube above the surface of Teris he cut
sharply to the right. Had their ship been faster it might
have worked. But it was not fast enough. Through the
blackness of space the exhausts of their pursuers flamed
closer. Ben&rsquo;s teeth clamped down on his lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;re out of luck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was nothing more to say. It was only a matter of
minutes before the guns of the ships behind them would blast
them to pieces. They held their

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>

breath and waited, watching the exhausts come through the
darkness.</p>

<p>And then suddenly there was no more darkness. A light as
bright as the noon sun flared. Ben let out a shout, for
beyond the light were lined the battle cruisers of Earth.
His pursuers turned tail and ran.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where the devil did those ships come from?&rdquo;
Davies gasped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I sent for them,&rdquo; Ben told him. &ldquo;We had
it all arranged. When I tackled that double I managed to
slip a microfilm capsule into his pocket. It had a complete
picture of my radona chart. As soon as the double reached
Earth, Intelligence grabbed him. All they had to do was
follow my chart to Teris.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were passing the flagship of the Earth fleet, and Ben
dipped the nose of his ship in salute. Then he turned to see
what was going on.</p>

<p>There was going to be no attempt to invade Teris. Instead,
its surface was illuminated with more of the flares. A
moment later Teris was gone, blasted by the guns of a
thousand cruisers. And for the strange women who would have
enslaved a universe, Ben felt no pity.</p>
